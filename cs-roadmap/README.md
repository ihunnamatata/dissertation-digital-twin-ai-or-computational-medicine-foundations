# Foundations of Computational Engineering

This is my comprehensive roadmap for mastering computer science and systems engineering from the ground up. It includes:

- 100+ foundational concepts (CS, math, algorithms, FP)
- 20 essential algorithms and 10 core data structures
- Functional programming theory (monads, optics, recursion schemes)
- Real-world build projects (FEM, interpreters, robotics, AI control)
- Daily, weekly, and long-term progression

## Why?
To prepare for my PhD in Computational Engineering, build an elite-level understanding of AI/robotics, and apply this knowledge in digital surgery, neuroscience, and simulation-based medicine.
