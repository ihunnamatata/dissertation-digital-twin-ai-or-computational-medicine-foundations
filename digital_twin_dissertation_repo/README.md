# Digital Twin Intelligence: Dissertation + Continued Learning

This repository hosts my PhD dissertation on multiscale AI systems for immune-guided surgery, organ therapy, and planetary health. It also serves as a structured journey through the computer science, engineering, and AI foundations I taught myself from the ground up.
